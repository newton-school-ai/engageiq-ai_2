"""WebSocket endpoint for real-time frame streaming.

Browser -> (base64 frame + timestamp over WebSocket) -> this endpoint

       -> src.scoring.engagement_score (weighted score, already implemented)
       -> (engagement score + nudge events back over WebSocket) -> Browser

This module is intentionally written against the *contract* of
``src.ingestion.frame_extractor`` rather than a finished implementation:
that module is still a stub (TODO) pending a teammate's work on #4. Once
#4 lands a real ``preprocess_frame`` (or equivalent), only the small
adapter call in ``_run_pipeline`` below should need updating -- the rest
of the connection-handling, auth, and broadcast logic is independent of
that detail.
